This is the main part of our app. Here you can type in any query, and you will receive a response.

<b><h2>Utterances</h2></b>

Each utterance is related to an <i>intent</i>. An intent is realated to an <i>entity</i> that consists of a <i>role</i>. 
There are currently two intents; 'feeling' and 'show_schedule'.  

show_shcedule has the 'day' intent

'day' has only one role associated with it; 'day'. The 'day' role consists of the following values: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, today, tomorrow, and tonight.

feeling has the 'state' intent

'state' consists of multiple roles including 'negative', 'very_negative', 'positive', 'very_positive' and 'neutral'. Additionally, each of these roles can have a value assocaited to it; for ex stressed_out, happy, excited, anxious, etc.
